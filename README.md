It demonstrates a couple of strategies for building an Angular application using the Umbraco backend.  This demo is only that, a demo and it isn't the best way or the only way of doing things.

This is an Umbraco 7.0.4 installation using the TXT starter kit.  There was no changes to the content except for adding a few images so if you are so inclined you can start with a new install, copy the web.config, global.asax, controllers, models, scripts, and Views and it should work for you.  Or, you can download this and run it.
